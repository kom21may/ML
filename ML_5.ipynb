The goal is to prepare data in a format that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms.

    "The average and median are two measures of central tendency used in statistics to describe the center of a data set. The average, also known as the mean, is the sum of all the data points divided by the total number of data points. It is sensitive to extreme values and may not be a representative value if the data is skewed or has outliers. On the other hand, the median is the middle value in a data set when the data is arranged in order of magnitude. It is less sensitive to extreme values and is often used when the data is skewed or has outliers. In general, the choice between the average and median depends on the nature of the data and the purpose of the analysis."
