    "1. Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability. in 100 words\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian interpretation of probability views probability as a measure of subjective belief or uncertainty about an event. It incorporates prior knowledge and updates it based on new evidence using Bayes' theorem. This interpretation emphasizes the role of personal beliefs and allows individuals to quantify their uncertainty using probability distributions. Prior probabilities reflect initial beliefs, while likelihood functions quantify the probability of observing the data given certain parameters. The Bayesian interpretation provides a framework for updating beliefs using observed data, enabling rational decision-making based on a combination of prior knowledge and empirical evidence."

They typically represent measurements or quantities that can be expressed as real numbers. Continuous random variables have an infinite number of possible outcomes, making them distinct from discrete random variables, which have a finite or countable number of possible outcomes. The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is described by a probability density function (PDF), such as the normal distribution. The probability of obtaining a specific value with a continuous random variable is zero since there are infinitely many possible values. Instead, probabilities are assigned to intervals or ranges of values."
