    "In machine learning, the target function is a mathematical representation of the relationship between the input data and the output data that the machine learning model tries to learn. It is also known as the objective function or the loss function. The target function takes in the input data as its argument and produces the predicted output values. The goal of the learning process is to find the best possible model that minimizes the difference between the predicted output values and the actual output values.\n",

    "For example, in a house price prediction model, the target function could be a linear equation that takes in the features of the house, such as the number of rooms, the square footage, and the location, and predicts the corresponding price of the house. The target function's fitness is assessed by comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices of the houses in the training set. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared. The target function's fitness is improved by adjusting the model's parameters during the training process to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual output values."
