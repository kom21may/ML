    "\n",
    "Data collection and preprocessing: Once you have defined the problem, you need to collect the relevant data and preprocess it for analysis. This involves tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.\n",

    "Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Before building a machine learning model, it is important to understand the data and identify patterns, trends, and relationships. EDA can help you identify outliers, understand the distribution of the data, and identify potential issues that need to be addressed before modeling.\n",

    "Model training and evaluation: After selecting a model, you need to train it on the data and evaluate its performance. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the testing set.\n",

    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features from the original set of features. The goal of feature selection is to improve the performance of the model by reducing overfitting, reducing training time, and improving the interpretability of the model. Feature selection techniques can be classified into three categories: filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Filter methods use statistical measures to evaluate the relevance of each feature, wrapper methods use a search algorithm to evaluate different subsets of features, and embedded methods incorporate feature selection into the model training process itself.\n",

    "Dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is the process of transforming the original set of features into a smaller set of features that retains as much of the original information as possible. The goal of dimensionality reduction is to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its performance by removing redundant or irrelevant features, reducing noise, and avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction techniques can be classified into two categories: linear methods, which use linear transformations to reduce the number of dimensions, and nonlinear methods, which use nonlinear transformations to reduce the number of dimensions.\n",

It is a type of bar chart that represents the frequencies of values in a dataset by grouping them into bins or intervals. The x-axis of a histogram represents the range of values in the dataset, and the y-axis represents the frequency or count of values in each bin.\n",

Histograms can be used to compare the distributions of two or more datasets, or to identify patterns or trends in the data.\n",
